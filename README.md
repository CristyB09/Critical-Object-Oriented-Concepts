Key OOP Concepts

The small application developed so far demonstrates some of the key concepts in objectoriented programming
• Classes and objects – a class is a template from which objects are created. Each object
has a collection of states (properties) as well as a collection of behaviours. States and
behaviours are implemented in Java as instance variables and methods.
• Abstraction – the user (client) is only aware of the operations that are provided on an
object, not how they are implemented.
• Encapsulation – variables and methods are wrapped in one single unit. Variables are
kept hidden (private) and can only be accessed from outside through setter and mutator
methods
